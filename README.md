# airbnb-clone-project


## Overview  
This project is a full-stack clone of the AirBnB platform, designed to simulate a real-world accommodation booking application.  
The goal is to build a functional web application where users can browse listings, view property details, and make bookings.  

## Project Goals
- Build a responsive and user-friendly interface  
- Structure a complex web application with clean architecture  
- Implement property search, filtering, and booking flow  
- Practice working collaboratively in defined roles  
- Follow best practices for modern web development  

## Tech Stack  
**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar)  
**Backend:** Node.js / Express (or equivalent)  
**Database:** PostgreSQL / MySQL (relational database)  
**Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
**Design Tools:** Figma for UI/UX design  
**Deployment:** Docker / CI/CD pipelines  

## Features (Planned)  
- 🔍 Property search and filtering  
- 🏠 Detailed property view with images  
- 🔑 User authentication & secure login  
- 💳 Booking and checkout process  
- 📱 Mobile-first responsive design  

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Planning
